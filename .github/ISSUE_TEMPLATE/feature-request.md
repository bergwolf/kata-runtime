# Repository consolidation notice
We have consolidated all code repositories to the
github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers repository
and new feature development happens there as well.

Also we have decided to feature freeze for kata 1.x releases.
Please submit any new feature requests to
github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers, Thanks!

If it is strongly desired to include a feature in the 1.x kata
releases, please backport it from the 2.0-dev branch after it
is merged there.
